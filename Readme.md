# Stack Implementation in C

This is a basic stack data structure implemented in C using a modular approach. The project demonstrates how to use dynamic memory, structure-based design, and a Makefile for compilation.

## 📁 Project Structure

|-> main.c : Contains the main application logic of menu driven for best user interaction
|-> stack.c: Contains all necessary operations of stack data structure implemented in that file
|-> stack.h: Contains only declaration of implemented operations stack.c 
|-> makefile: Automate the compilation system 

## ⚙️ Features

- Create a stack of user-defined size
- Push elements into the stack
- Pop elements from the stack
- Peek at specific index
- Check if stack is full or empty
- Display all elements of the stack

## 🧪 How to Run

1. **Compile the project:** 
   just run the command
   make

2. **Run the project:**
   run the command
   ./stack_app
   
3. **For Clean Up**
    just run the command
    make clean

## ⚙️ Note
This is a beginner-level project aimed at understanding how to:

Structure C projects

Use Makefiles

Work with dynamic memory and modular code
